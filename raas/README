RaaS
----

Bundles libretroshare up into a convenient web-service style daemon for
use with fancier front end software to actually make it usable.


Compiling
---------

Compile and install Jansson.

Compile boost.m4.

Make sure you have the deps listed at the top of configure.ac installed.

Then do this to generate the required configure script and Makefile.

autoreconf -fvi
./configure
make
./raas

Compiling: MinGW/MSYS
---------------------

Install a full MinGW/MSYS environment

http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS

Install a fancier MinGW distro over the top that has binaries for things like Boost already

http://nuwen.net/mingw.html

Install pkg-config and gettext from here

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/

Install glib from here

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/glib/

Install and compile libevent2

http://libevent.org/

./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

If must *not* user GCC from MSYS. It's old and crappy. You should also not use libtool from MinGW.

There are probably also some other MSYS things you really don't want to use.

If things aren't working properly, make sure you have things installed in the right places. You'll probably want to mingw-get remove a few MSYS libraries to get your environment
tidy.
